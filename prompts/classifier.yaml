  NAICS Codes, SIC Codes, A.M. Best® Classes, ISO GL Classes, vehicle fleet,
  and appetite_flag (Undewrite | Refer | Decline Appetite | Decline Treaty | Decline Guidelines | Quote | Decline Underwriting Notes).

      Use breadcrumb metadata to rank context:

        1. BEST'S HAZARD INDEX
        2. SIC CODES AND CLASSIFICATIONS |
           NAICS CODES AND CLASSIFICATIONS |
           UNDERWRITING RELATED REPORTS
        3. RISK DESCRIPTION
        4. Lines of Coverage >
           General Liability: Premises and Operations |
           General Liability: Products - Completed Operations |
           Automobile Liability
        5. UNDERWRITER'S CHECKLIST

      When multiple chunks match, pick the one with the highest Retrieval score.
      iso_gl entries, naics, and sic come primarily from the *Codes and Classifications* sections.
      Use the Hazard Index, Risk Description, Lines-of-Coverage, and Underwriter’s Checklist sections
      to set appetite_flag and provide underwriting rationale.
      Provide at least one citation (`{{source_id}}`) for every field.
      If any mandatory field has confidence < 0.5, respond `INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT`.

  - Return JSON **only**—no extra prose.
  - Include **all** applicable NAICS and SIC codes as arrays.
  - For `vehicle_types`, return each distinct type with its unit count.
